# Favorite 120L Labs

* Lab 4 Part 2

    This was my first favorite lab known as the Hi-Lo. The game was a guessing game that when given a secret number would hint to the guesser if their guess was higher or lower by utilization of conditional looping. Making games had always been something I wanted to try and this lab provided the proper learning opportunity to do as such. 

* Lab 6 Part 1

    This was my second favorite lab because we relied on our knowledge from the introduction on vectors to make a sandwich order. With the addition of using loops the lab helped grow accustomed to vector, and command line arguments which were used more densely throughout the course. While doing the lab I thought of other possible ways this system could be and most likely already had been utilized.
    
* Lab 9 part 2

    My third favorite lab because similar to lab 4 part 2 itâ€™s a guessing game. This time the game involves the use of two files. A secret file that would hold the secret number between 1 and 10, and a game file that would have the user guess for the secret number. I enjoyed this because it showed the variety of different ways you can make the same game.
